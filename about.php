        <li>Which parts did you have trouble with?
            <ul>
                <li>I mostly had trouble with writing the advanced query for updating the friends table after adding the friend. It was the most challenging part that i faced as i was not much familier with writing advanced queries.</li>

        </li>
        <li>What would you like to do better next time?
            <ul>
                <li>Next time i would probably create a better interface. Other than that i would learn sql and different queries which would make it a lot easier to do.<li>
